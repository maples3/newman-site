<h1>Welcome!</h1>
<p>Welcome to the Catholic Newman Club at Northern Kentucky University!
We are a community of like-minded Catholic individuals striving
for sainthood and helping each other along the way.</p>

<h3>Our Chapel</h3><a href="images/chapel-1820x1024.jpg"><img src="images/chapel-356x200.jpg" alt="Our new chapel!"></a><p>During the Fall 2016 semester, we ran into an unusual dillema:
we had a surge in membership, and we could no longer fit all of
the members in our chapel for Mass every week!
So during the winter break, several of us moved the chapel
to a larger room in the basement of the Newman house.</p>
<p>The new chapel can support many more members and
has the potential to be expanded further in the future.</p>
