<h3>Weekly</h3>
<p>Every Tuesday night we have a student-led Bible study at the Newman center starting at 7:00pm.
Bible study usually lasts an hour, but a lot of us like to hang out and talk for a while afterward.</p>
<p>On Thursday night, we have Adoration or Apologetics at the Newman center (alternating weeks).
Then we have Mass starting at 7:00pm.  After Mass we have a quick meeting, then dinner prepared by
student volunteers.</p>

<h3>Other events</h3>
<p>We have many other events throughout the school year, such as movie nights and dances.</p>
<p>Every year, we usually have Ash Wednesday Mass in the University Center or Student Union.</p>
