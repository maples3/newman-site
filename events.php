<h3>Weekly Events</h3>
<p>Every Tuesday night we have a student-led Bible study at the Newman center starting at 7:00pm.
Bible study usually lasts an hour, but a lot of us like to hang out and talk for a while afterward.</p>
<p>On Thursday nights, we have Adoration (6:30pm) or Apologetics (6:15pm) at the Newman center (alternating weeks).
Then we have Mass starting at 7:00pm.  After Mass we have a quick meeting, then dinner prepared by
student volunteers.</p>

<h3>Other events</h3>
<p>We have many other events throughout the school year, such as movie nights and dances.</p>
<p>Every year, we have Ash Wednesday Mass in the University Center or Student Union.
This year, we're planning on having Mass on campus for Holy Days of obligation as well
(updates coming soon).</p>
