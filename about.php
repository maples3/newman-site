<p>We are blessed to have a location for the Newman Center to meet,
which we have affectionately named the Newman House.  All of our meetings
take place here, and it also contains our chapel.
During the school year, it's also a great place to head
after class to pray, do homework, or hang out with friends.</p>
<p>The Newman House is located at
19 Clearview Drive, Highland Heights, KY 41076
(<a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/19+Clearview+Dr,+Highland+Heights,+KY+41076" target="_blank">Map</a>).
It's just up the hill at the end of the BB&amp;T Arena parking lot
and across the street from the University Garage.</p>
